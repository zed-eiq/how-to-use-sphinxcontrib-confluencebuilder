Introduction
===============

This is a guide to using reStructuredText and Sphinx.

:reStructuredText:
  …is a markdown language (note: not *Markdown*) that
  is used in Sphinx. It is a feature rich language that,
  unfortunately, shares a predeliction for whitespace
  and magic with Python. But that *also* makes it
  a suitable markdown language for use
  with documenting Python code-bases.
:Sphinx:
  …is a Python-based static-site generator used
  to build documentation for Python code-bases.
  
  It has a powerful ``autodoc`` utility that can
  extract comments from ``.py`` files and generate
  documentation from it.
